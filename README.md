## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project is to brush up on my (long ago) knowledge on HTML and CSS. Nothing fancy, just basic HTML and CSS.

Two main things learned from this project:
- Positioning the items using Flexbox
- When sizing the items, try to minimize control on the size of the content, set the container size and let content flow; think about whether (min)height/(min)width should be set or not

### Useful resources
